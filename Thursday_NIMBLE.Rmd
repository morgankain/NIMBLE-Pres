## NIMBLE: Numerical Inference for statistical Models for Bayesian and Likelihood Estimation

NIMBLE is built in R but compiles your models and algorithms using C++ for speed <br />
NIMBLE is most commonly used for MCMC but can also be used to implement a series of other algorithms (e.g. particle filtering, MCEM) <br />
1. A system for writing statistical models flexibly, which is an extension of the BUGS language <br />
2. A library of algorithms such as MCMC. <br />
3. A language, called NIMBLE, embedded within and similar in style to R, for writing algorithms that operate on BUGS models. <br />
  
One of the most important concepts behind NIMBLE is to allow a combination of highlevel processing in R and low-level processing in compiled C++. <br />

##### Why NIMBLE?

1. Options (More customizable MCMC, ability to run JAGS models and STAN models, EM, particle filter) that leads to a more adaptable workflow <br />
2. User-defined functions and distributions – written as nimbleFunctions – can be used in model code.  <br />
3. Multiple parameterizations for distributions, similar to those in R, can be used. <br />
  e.g. normal distribution with BUGS parameter order: <br />
        x ~ dnorm(a + b * c, tau) <br />
       normal distribution with a named parameter: <br />
        y ~ dnorm(a + b * c, sd = sigma) <br />
4. Named parameters for distributions and functions, similar to R function calls, can be used. <br />
5. More flexible indexing of vector nodes within larger variables is allowed. For example one can place a multivariate normal vector arbitrarily within a higher-dimensional object, not just in the last index. <br />
6. More general constraints can be declared using dconstraint, which extends the concept of JAGS’ dinterval. <br />

#### Downloading, installing and loading NIMBLE

On Windows, you should download and install Rtools.exe available from http://cran. r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/.  <br />
On OS X, you should install Xcode.  <br />

After these are installed you can install NIMBLE in R using <br />
install.packages("nimble", repos = "http://r-nimble.org", type = "source") <br />

Please post about installation problems to the nimble-users Google group or email nimble.stats@gmail.com.

You will also need to download STAN using the following commands <br />
Sys.setenv(MAKEFLAGS = "-j4") <br />
install.packages("rstan", dependencies = TRUE) <br />

In total you will need the following pakages:

```{r loadpackage, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, verbose = FALSE}
library("nimble")
library("R2jags")
library("ggplot2")
library("nimble")
library("rstan")
library("igraph")
library("parallel")
library("mcmcplots")
library("lattice")
library("coda")
```

#### Things to know about working with NIMBLE

<b> Programming in NIMBLE involves a fundamental distinction between: </b> <br />
  1. the steps for an algorithm that need to happen only once, at the beginning, such as inspecting the model <br />
  2. the steps that need to happen each time a function is called, such as MCMC iterations. <br />
    When one writes a nimbleFunction, each of these parts can be provided separately. 

Multiple parameterizations for distributions, similar to those in R, can be used.
NIMBLE calls non-stochastic nodes “deterministic”, whereas BUGS calls them “logical”. 
NIMBLE uses “logical” in the way R does, to refer to boolean (TRUE/FALSE) variables. <br />
Alternative models can be defined from the same model code by using if-then-else statements that are evaluated when the model is defined.

1. NIMBLE extracts all the declarations in the BUGS code to create a model definition. <br />
2. From the model definition, NIMBLE builds a working model in R. This can be used to manipulate variables and operate the model from R. Operating the model includes calculating, simulating, or querying the log probability value of model nodes. <br />
3. From the working model, NIMBLE generates customized C++ code representing the model, compiles the C++, loads it back into R, and provides an R object that interfaces to it. We often call the uncompiled model the “R-model” and the compiled model the “C-model.” <br />

### Part 1

##### <a name="1.1"> 1.1 Build a chain binomial model in JAGS </a>
First step is to construct the simulator from which we will obtain our data <br />

Note: It will be important to set your current working directory to "../stat744/notes/NIMBLE" <br />

Set parameters and load the Chain Binomial simulator <br />

```{r, cache.rebuild = TRUE}
beta <- 0.02
pop <- 100
effpropS <- 0.8
effpropI <- 0.2
reporting <- 0.5

s0 <- effpropS*pop
r0 <- 0
zerohack <- 0.001
numobs <- 12
nimtimevec <- c()
source("CBsimulator.R")
```


```{r, cache.rebuild = TRUE}
sim <- simCB(beta = beta, pop = pop, effpropS = effpropS, effpropI = effpropI, 
             t0 = 1, numobs = numobs, reporting = reporting, seed = 3)
sim
```

Take a peek at what this model produces

```{r, echo=FALSE}
  ggplot(data.frame(sim), aes(time, S)) + geom_point(colour = "blue") + 
    geom_line(colour = "blue") +
    geom_line(data = data.frame(sim), aes(time, I), colour = "red") +
    geom_line(data = data.frame(sim), aes(time, R), colour = "green") +
    theme_bw()
```

Set up the required arguments to run the JAGS model

```{r, tidy = TRUE}
data <- list(obs = sim$Iobs,
             pop = pop,
             numobs = nrow(sim),
             r0 = r0)

inits <- list(list(
  I = sim$I*1,
  effpropS = effpropS - 0.1,
  effpropI = effpropI - 0.15,
  beta = beta + .05,
  reporting = reporting),
list(
  I = sim$I*1 + 1,
  effpropS = effpropS - 0.1,
  effpropI = effpropI + 0.2,
  beta = beta + .1,
  reporting = reporting),
list(
  I = sim$I*1 + 2,
  effpropS = effpropS,
  effpropI = effpropI,
  beta = beta - .008,
  reporting = reporting)
)

params = c("beta",
           "effpropS",
           "effpropI",
           "reporting")

#rjags::set.factory("bugs::Conjugate", FALSE, type="sampler")
```

Create the model and examine the MCMC algorithms that JAGS will use to sample <br />

```{r}
cbjagsmodel <- jags.model(data = data,
               inits = inits,
               file = "CB.bug",
               n.chains = length(inits))

list.samplers(cbjagsmodel)
```

Run some chains (could use coda::coda.samples from cbjagsmodel but here we will just run jags()) <br />

```{r}
jagstime <- system.time(cbjags <- jags(data = data,
               inits = inits,
               param = params,
               model.file = "CB.bug",
               n.iter = 11000,
               n.burnin = 1000,
               n.thin = 20,
               n.chains = length(inits)))
```

```{r}
cbjags
xyplot(as.mcmc(cbjags))
```

##### <a name="1.2"> 1.2 Build the NIMLE model </a>

```{r}
source('nimCB.R')
```

Set up the model. Here we need: Constants, Data, Initial Values, NIMBLE model object <br />

```{r}
nimCBdata <- list(obs = sim$Iobs)

nimCBcon <- list(numobs = numobs, pop = pop, r0 = r0)

nimCBinits <- list(I = sim$I,
                   effpropS = effpropS,
                   effpropI = effpropI,
                   beta = beta,
                   reporting = reporting,
                   s0 = s0)

nimtimevec[1] <- system.time(CBout <- nimbleModel(code = nimcode, 
                         name = 'CBout', 
                         constants = nimCBcon,
                         data = nimCBdata, 
                         inits = nimCBinits))[3]
```

##### <a name="1.2.1"> 1.2.1 Model exploration/conversion </a>

```{r}
CBout$getNodeNames()
```

```{r}
CBout$obs
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
plot(CBout$graph)
```

nimbleModel does its best to initialize a model, but let’s say you want to re-initialize I. <br />

```{r}
simulate(CBout, 'I')
CBout$I
```

```{r}
CBout$getDependencies(c("beta"))
```

```{r}
CBout$getDependencies(c("beta"), determOnly = TRUE)
```

##### <a name="1.2.2"> 1.2.2 Compile the C++ model, build the MCMC and Run </a>

```{r}
nimtimevec[2] <- system.time(CBoutC <- compileNimble(CBout))[3]
```

Configure the MCMC with the default options (we will return to customizing this setup later) <br />

```{r, message=FALSE, verbose = FALSE, warning = FALSE, errors = FALSE}
nimtimevec[3] <- system.time(CBoutSpec <- configureMCMC(CBout, print = TRUE))[3]
```

Add chain monitors for the parameters of interest and add thinning <br />

```{r}
CBoutSpec$addMonitors(c("beta", "effpropS", "effpropI", "reporting"))

CBoutSpec$setThin(20)
```

Build the MCMC <br />

```{r}
nimtimevec[4] <- system.time(CBoutMCMC <- buildMCMC(CBoutSpec))[3]

nimtimevec[5] <- system.time(CBoutMCMC <- compileNimble(CBoutMCMC, project = CBout, resetFunctions = TRUE))[3]
```

```{r}
niter <- 11000

set.seed(0)
nimtimevec[6] <- system.time(CBoutMCMC$run(niter))[3]
```

Quick peek at time required. Below we will take a look at efficiency using a convenient coda function <br />

Gross time required <br />

```{r}
jagstime[3]
sum(nimtimevec[1:6], na.rm = TRUE)
nimtimevec[6]
```

Efficiency (Net time in a sense) <br />

```{r}
samples <- as.matrix(CBoutMCMC$mvSamples)

head(samples)

jags_eff <- effectiveSize(as.mcmc.list(as.mcmc(cbjags))) / nimtimevec[1]
nim_eff <- effectiveSize(as.mcmc.list(as.mcmc(samples))) / nimtimevec[6]

jags_eff
nim_eff

```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
  samples <- as.matrix(CBoutMCMC$mvSamples)
  par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mai = c(.6, .5, .1, .2))
  plot(samples[ , 'beta'], type = 'l', xlab = 'iteration')
  plot(samples[ , 'effpropS'], type = 'l', xlab = 'iteration')
  plot(samples[ , 'effpropI'], type = 'l', xlab = 'iteration')
  plot(samples[ , 'reporting'], type = 'l', xlab = 'iteration')
  par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
  plot(samples[ , 'effpropS'], samples[ , 'effpropI'], pch = 20)
```

Save these points for later

```{r}
  def_effS <- samples[ , 'effpropS']
  def_effI <- samples[ , 'effpropI']
```

Look at the correlation in the chains

```{r}
  acf(samples[, "beta"])
  acf(samples[, "reporting"])
  acf(samples[, "effpropS"])
  acf(samples[, "effpropI"])
```

##### <a name="1.2.3"> 1.2.3 Small MCMC specification adjustment </a>

A few undesirable results here... we can add a block sampler to decrease correlation <br />

Take a look at the samplers being used <br />

```{r}
CBoutSpec$getSamplers()
```
  
```{r}
CBoutSpec$addSampler(target = c('effpropS', 'effpropI'), type = 'RW_block',
                      control = list(adaptInterval = 10000))
```

```{r}
CBoutSpec$setThin(30)
```

```{r}
CBoutMCMC <- buildMCMC(CBoutSpec)
```

```{r}
CBoutMCMC <- compileNimble(CBoutMCMC, project  = CBout, resetFunctions = TRUE)
```

```{r}
CBoutMCMC$run(30000)
samplesNew <- as.matrix(CBoutMCMC$mvSamples)
```

Check for an imporvement

```{r}
  par(mfrow = c(2,2))
  acf(samplesNew[, "effpropS"])
  acf(samplesNew[, "effpropI"])
  plot(samplesNew[ , 'effpropS'], type = 'l', xlab = 'iteration')
  plot(samplesNew[ , 'effpropI'], type = 'l', xlab = 'iteration')
  par(mfrow = c(1,1))
  plot(samplesNew[ , 'effpropS'], samplesNew[ , 'effpropI'], pch = 20)
  points(def_effS, def_effI, pch = 20, col = "blue")
```

Well that didn't do anything... <br />

NIMBLE allows for specification of samplers by parameter or node by node (NIMBLE included or user created) <br />

```{r}
CBout <- nimbleModel(code = nimcode, 
                         name = 'CBout', 
                         constants = nimCBcon,
                         data = nimCBdata, 
                         inits = nimCBinits)
  
CBoutC <- compileNimble(CBout)
  
CBoutSpec <- configureMCMC(CBout, print = TRUE)

CBoutSpec$addMonitors(c("beta", "effpropS", "effpropI", "reporting"))

CBoutSpec$setThin(20)
```

```{r}
CBoutSpec$removeSamplers(c("beta", "effpropS", "effpropI", "reporting"), print = TRUE)
CBoutSpec$addSampler("beta", type = "slice", print = TRUE)
CBoutSpec$addSampler("effpropS", type = "slice", print = TRUE)
CBoutSpec$addSampler("effpropI", type = "slice", print = TRUE)
CBoutSpec$addSampler("reporting", type = "slice", print = TRUE)
```

```{r}
CBoutMCMC <- buildMCMC(CBoutSpec)
CBoutMCMC <- compileNimble(CBoutMCMC, project  = CBout, resetFunctions = TRUE)
```

```{r}
CBoutMCMC$run(30000)
samplesNew <- as.matrix(CBoutMCMC$mvSamples)
```

```{r}
  par(mfrow = c(2,2))
  acf(samplesNew[, "effpropS"])
  acf(samplesNew[, "effpropI"])
  plot(samplesNew[ , 'effpropS'], type = 'l', xlab = 'iteration')
  plot(samplesNew[ , 'effpropI'], type = 'l', xlab = 'iteration')
  par(mfrow = c(1,1))
  plot(samplesNew[ , 'effpropS'], samplesNew[ , 'effpropI'], pch = 20)
  points(def_effS, def_effI, pch = 20, col = "blue")
```

##### <a name="1.3"> 1.3 Compare the JAGS and NIMBLE results </a>

We can also compare the NIMBLE model simultaneously with the JAGS model using MCMCsuite() <br />

Be warned: running this code will produce about 6-8 graphs which will all pop up in separate windows! <br />

```{r}
nimcb <- MCMCsuite(code = nimcode,
                   data = nimCBdata,
                   inits = nimCBinits,
                   constants = nimCBcon,
                   MCMCs = c("jags", "nimble"),
                   monitors = c("beta", "reporting", "effpropS", "effpropI"),
                   niter = 12000,
                   calculateEfficiency = TRUE,
                   makePlot = FALSE,
                   savePlot = FALSE)

  nimcb$timing
```

##### Part 5:  

<a name="5.1"> NIMBLE Notes </a>

**Truncation of distributions** <br />
   • x ∼ N(0, sd = 10) T(0, a)$, or <br />
   • x ∼ T(dnorm(0, sd = 10), 0, a), <br />

   • mu1 ~ dnorm(0, 1) <br />
   • mu2 ~ dnorm(0, 1) <br />
   • constraint_data ~ dconstraint( mu1 + mu2 > 0 ) <br />
   
**Lifted Nodes** <br />
   • The use of link functions causes new nodes to be introduced <br />
   • When distribution parameters are expressions, NIMBLE creates a new deterministic node that contains the expression for a given parameter <br />
   
**logProb** <br />
    • For each variable that contains at least one stochastic node, NIMBLE generates a model variable with the prefix “logProb” <br />
    • Can be retrieved with getLogProb
    
**Choice of Samplers** <br /> 
    1. If the node has no stochastic dependents, a predictive end sampler is assigned. The end sampling algorithm merely calls simulate on the particular node. <br /> 
    2. The node is checked for presence of a conjugate relationship between its prior distribution and the distributions of its stochastic dependents. If it is determined to be in a conjugate relationship, then the corresponding conjugate (Gibbs) sampler is assigned. <br /> 
    3. If the node is discrete-valued, then a slice sampler is assigned [5]. <br /> 
    4. If the node follows a multivariate distribution, then a RW block sampler is assigned for all elements. This is a Metropolis-Hastings adaptive random-walk sampler with a multivariate normal proposal [6]. <br /> 
    5. If none of the above criteria are satisfied, then a RW sampler is assigned. This is a Metropolis-Hastings adaptive random-walk sampler with a univariate normal proposal distribution. <br /> 
    
**Missing Values** <br />
